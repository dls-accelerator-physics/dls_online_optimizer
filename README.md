Work done during a 2017 Summer internship at Diamond Light Source Synchrotron.

Included in this repository are:

  - DLS-OnlineOptimiser: A complete package for online multi-objective optimisation of the Diamond Light Source synchrotron for use in the control room.
  - Benchmarking: The DLS-OnlineOptimiser package includes three multi-objective optimisers. This directory contains data and scripts for the benchmarking of these algorithms.
  - MOPSO_tune: This directory conatins methods of finding the optimimum settings for a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimiser.
  - Simple_Scan: Contained in this directory is a set of scripts for investigating parameter scans in the control room.
  - Machine_Tests: This contains multiple folders for machine tests that were carried out in the control room. Plots and raw data are included
